# Terro's Real Estate House Pricing Analysis

## Introduction üè†

Terro's Real Estate is an agency that estimates the pricing of houses in a certain locality. They do this by analyzing different features/factors of a property, like pollution level (NOX), crime rate, education facilities (pupil-teacher ratio), and connectivity (distance from highway). This helps them determine the price of a property.

In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and linear regression on the Boston Housing dataset. Through my analysis, I observed many findings. For example, the crime rate and the proportion of lower-status people in the neighborhood are negatively correlated with house prices. The findings of this study will help Terro's Real Estate better understand the factors that affect house prices in Boston, and to develop more accurate pricing models.

## Conclusion üìä

- **Comprehensive Regression Analysis:** We conducted a thorough regression analysis to understand the relationship between various independent variables and the average house price (AVG_PRICE) in a particular town.

- **Data Exploration:** We started by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and identifying potential outliers.

- **Correlation Analysis:** Next, we performed a correlation analysis to identify any significant correlations between the independent variables and AVG_PRICE.

- **Feature Selection:** Based on this analysis, we selected the most relevant independent variables, including AGE, INDUS, NOX, DISTANCE, TAX, PTRATIO, AVG_ROOM, and LSTAT, to build our regression model.

- **Model Building and Evaluation:** We built the regression model and evaluated its performance using various statistical metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and significance tests. 

- **High Model Performance:** The model exhibited a reasonably high R-squared value, indicating that the selected independent variables collectively explain a substantial portion of the variability in AVG_PRICE.
